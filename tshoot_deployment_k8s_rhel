This error is likely caused by:
        - The kubelet is not running
        - The kubelet is unhealthy due to a misconfiguration of the node in some way (required cgroups disabled)

kubelet error:
 "command failed" err="failed to load kubelet config file, path: /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml, error: faile> error failed to read kubelet config file \"/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml\", error: open /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml: no such file or directory"

Solution to generate /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml file:

# sudo kubeadm init phase kubelet-start

# systemctl status kubelet

kubelet.service - kubelet: The Kubernetes Node Agent
